# Frontend Layout

For readers using or customising the web dashboard served by `kt web` / `kt app` / `kt serve`.

The dashboard uses a configurable binary split tree: every pane is either a leaf (one panel) or a split (two children with a draggable handle). Presets swap the whole tree at once; edit mode rearranges it in place.

See also: [Serving](serving.md) for how to open the dashboard.

## Dashboard refresh preference

The Dashboard's auto-refresh selector remembers Off, 5s (default), 15s, or
60s through the shared UI preference storage, across tab switches and app
restarts. Opening the Dashboard always loads current data once; Off disables
its subsequent periodic refreshes. Leaving the Dashboard stops its timer.
The shell's running-instance poll and the statistics card's metrics poll
remain independent of this selector.

## Core concepts

- **Panel**: a single-responsibility view (Chat, Files, Activity, State,
  Canvas, Debug, Settings, Terminal, etc.). Panels are registered in
  `stores/layoutPanels.js` and resolved by id.
- **Split tree**: a binary tree where each node is either a *leaf*
  (renders one panel) or a *split* (divides space into two children
  with a draggable handle). Splits can be horizontal (left | right) or
  vertical (top / bottom).
- **Preset**: a named split tree configuration. Switching presets
  replaces the entire tree instantly. Presets are either builtin
  (shipped with KT) or user-created.
- **Header**: top bar with instance info, preset dropdown, edit layout
  button, Ctrl+K palette trigger, and stop button.
- **Status bar**: bottom bar with model switcher, session id, job count,
  runtime.

## Default presets

| Shortcut | Preset | Layout |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Ctrl+1 | Chat Focus | chat \| status (top) + creature state (bottom) |
| Ctrl+2 | Workspace | files \| editor+terminal \| chat+activity |
| Ctrl+3 | Multi-creature | creatures \| chat \| activity+state |
| Ctrl+4 | Canvas | chat \| canvas+activity |
| Ctrl+5 | Debug | chat+state (top) / debug (bottom) |
| Ctrl+6 | Settings | settings (full screen) |

Every freshly opened instance lands on Chat Focus, whatever its shape:
the Status rail carries the creature list, so a multi-creature graph is
operable without switching layouts. The Creatures tab on that rail
exists only once the graph has more than one creature; it shows the
member count and glows when the graph grows while you are looking
elsewhere. A solo session shows no creature chrome at all.
Multi-creature stays available on Ctrl+3 for the wide layout. The last-used preset per instance is remembered in
localStorage and always wins over the default.

The panel picker and the palette list each panel with a one-line
description; the two legacy aliases (`file-tree`, `editor-status`) are
resolvable by the legacy presets but are never offered.

## Collapsing panels

Use the arrow buttons in a divider to collapse either side of the split.
The remaining panel fills the available space; the arrow at its edge restores
the hidden side to its previous size. This works for left/right and top/bottom
splits, including nested splits in custom layouts.

Hidden panels keep their drafts and running terminal state. Collapse applies
only to the current workspace view and is not saved into the preset. Switching
layouts, reloading the page, or entering layout edit mode reveals the panels.

## Edit mode

Press **Ctrl+Shift+L** or click the edit button in the header to enter
edit mode. Each panel leaf shows an amber bar with:

- **Replace**: swap the panel with any registered panel via a picker
  modal
- **Split H / Split V**: split the current leaf into two, creating a new
  empty slot
- **Close**: remove the panel (its sibling takes the parent's space)
- **"+ Add panel"** button on empty slots

The edit mode banner at the top provides:
- **Save**: persists changes (user presets only; builtins can't be
  overwritten)
- **Save as new**: creates a new user preset with a custom name
- **Revert**: discards all changes and restores the original
- **Exit**: leaves edit mode (prompts if unsaved changes exist)

All edits happen on a deep clone of the preset. The original is never
modified until explicitly saved.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Ctrl+1..6 | Switch to preset |
| Ctrl+Shift+L | Toggle edit mode |
| Ctrl+K | Open command palette |
| Esc | Exit edit mode |

Ctrl+K always fires even when an input is focused. Preset shortcuts are
blocked inside text inputs/textareas.

## Command palette

Open with Ctrl+K. Fuzzy-matches against every registered command:

- `Mode: <preset>`: switch to any preset
- `Panel: <panel>`: add a panel to its preferred zone
- `Layout: edit / save as / reset`
- `Debug: open logs`

Prefix routing: `>` commands (default), `@` mentions, `#` sessions,
`/` slash commands.

## Panels

### Chat
The main conversation interface. Supports message edit+rerun,
regenerate, tool call accordion, sub-agent nesting.

### Status (tabbed rail)
Five tabs: Session (agent, model, provider, session id, status),
Creatures (only for a graph with more than one creature: every member
with focus-on-click, start / stop, and a per-creature model switch,
plus the channels; the rail icon carries the member count), Tokens (in/out/cache + context bar with compact
threshold), Jobs (running tool calls with stop button), Modules (the
full modules surface).

### Overview
The same session identity, token usage, and running jobs as one dense
scroll with no tabs. Not in any default preset; pick it from the panel
picker when you prefer everything on screen at once.

### Jobs
Model, context bar, and running jobs only. Used by the Settings preset.

### Creature State (tabbed)
Four tabs: Drives (the focused creature's drives with the same
management as the full Drives panel: pause, resume, wake, cancel,
complete, progress notes, and a New goal form; a scope toggle shows the
whole graph, and "Open full panel" opens the Drives panel as a drawer),
Scratchpad (key-value pairs from the agent's working memory), Memory
(FTS5 search over session events), Compaction (history of context
compactions).

### Drives
Every drive in the session grouped by assignee, with the full record
detail. Reachable from the panel picker, the header badge, and the
Creature State panel's "Open full panel".

### Files
File tree with refresh + a "Touched" view showing files the agent
read/wrote/errored, grouped by action.

### Editor
Monaco editor with file tabs, dirty indicators, Ctrl+S save. For
markdown files (.md/.markdown/.mdx), a toggle switches between Monaco
(code mode) and Vditor (rich WYSIWYG markdown with toolbar, math, and
code blocks).

### Canvas
Auto-detects long code blocks (15+ lines) and `##canvas##` markers from
assistant messages. Shows syntax-highlighted code with line numbers,
rendered markdown, or sandboxed HTML. Copy and download buttons in the
tab strip.

Use the `canvas_image` tool to publish a local image file. Completed image
publications appear even when the tool finishes in the background; older
results can also be recovered from their image output when preview metadata
is absent.

Closing a file/tool preview with ×, or clearing the canvas, remembers the
dismissed publications in this browser for that session across refreshes.
A new tool publication can show the file again, including when its image
contents are unchanged. Saved dismissal records contain compact revision
fingerprints rather than image data or document bodies.

### Terminal
xterm.js terminal connected to a PTY shell (bash/PowerShell) in the
agent's working directory. Supports Nerd Font glyphs, resize, and
light/dark theme.

### Debug (tabbed)
Four tabs: Logs (live tail of the API server log via WebSocket), Trace
(waterfall of tool call timings), Prompt (current system prompt with
diff), Events (firehose of all chat store messages).

### Settings (tabbed)
Seven tabs: Session, Tokens, Jobs, Extensions (installed packages),
Triggers (active triggers), Cost (token cost estimate), Environment
(cwd + redacted env vars).

### Creatures (terrarium only)
Creature list with status dots + channel list. Click a creature to
switch the chat tab.

## Detach to window

In edit mode, panels with `supportsDetach: true` can be popped out via
the Pop Out kebab action. The detached window is a minimal shell at
`/detached/<instanceId>--<panelId>` that connects independently to the
backend.

## Status bar

Always visible at the bottom:
- Instance name + status dot
- Model quick switcher (dropdown) + settings gear
- Session id (click to copy)
- Running jobs count
- Runtime elapsed

## Technical details

The split tree is stored as a plain JSON structure:
```json
{
  "type": "split",
  "direction": "horizontal",
  "ratio": 70,
  "children": [
    { "type": "leaf", "panelId": "chat" },
    { "type": "split", "direction": "vertical", "ratio": 50,
      "children": [
        { "type": "leaf", "panelId": "activity" },
        { "type": "leaf", "panelId": "state" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The `LayoutNode.vue` component is recursive: splits render two children
with a draggable handle, leaves render the panel component via
`<component :is>`. Panel runtime props flow through Vue's
provide/inject from the route page.
